# moonbit-pcap

Pure MoonBit packet-capture parsing and network analysis for PCAP and PCAPNG
data. The library has no libpcap or C runtime dependency and is suitable for
offline analysis, embedded tooling, CLI utilities, and WebAssembly hosts.

## Features

- Endian-aware binary readers, writers, cursors, queues, checksums, CRCs, hex,
  Base64, and bounded varints.
- Classic PCAP and PCAPNG readers and writers with structural validators.
- Ethernet, VLAN, ARP, IPv4, IPv6 extensions, ICMP, ICMPv6, TCP, UDP, SCTP,
  DNS, HTTP, MQTT, CoAP, CAN, Modbus TCP, PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, and DNP3
  parsing.
- Bounded TCP stream, UDP flow, and IP fragment reassembly.
- Traffic statistics, time series, RTT, bandwidth, filtering, packet
  classification, anomaly detection, and Markdown/JSON/CSV/HTML/text export.
- CLI and WebAssembly integration points.

## Requirements

- MoonBit stable toolchain (the CI installs the current stable release).
- No native packet-capture library is required.

## Installation

Add the package to a MoonBit module:

```text
moon add cghyyrrt/moonbit-pcap
```

Then import the package you need:

```moonbit
import "cghyyrrt/moonbit-pcap/src/pcap"
import "cghyyrrt/moonbit-pcap/src/layers"

fn inspect_capture(bytes : Bytes) -> Int {
  match @pcap.PcapReader::new(bytes) {
    Some(reader) => reader.read_all().length()
    None => 0
  }
}
```

## Package layout

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/binary` | Safe binary I/O, cursors, queues, checksums, CRCs, and encoders |
| `src/pcap` | Classic PCAP headers, packets, writer, validator, and filters |
| `src/pcapng` | PCAPNG blocks, options, writer, and validator |
| `src/layers` | Link, network, transport, application, and industrial protocols |
| `src/reassembly` | TCP, UDP, IP-fragment, and bounded stream reassembly |
| `src/analyzer` | Statistics, sessions, rates, reports, and anomaly detection |
| `src/exporter` | JSON, CSV, HTML, terminal, and Markdown reports |
| `src/cli` | Command-line analysis pipeline |
| `src/wasm` | WebAssembly-facing integration functions |

## Validation

Run the same checks locally as CI:

```text
moon fmt --check
moon check --deny-warn --target all
moon test --deny-warn
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/source-metrics.ps1
moon bench benchmarks
```

The source metric script counts only handwritten `.mbt` files under `src/` and
`cmd/`; generated `_build/` files are excluded. The current verified metric is
available from the script output rather than maintained as an unchecked claim.

The benchmark uses a fixed 42-byte Ethernet/IPv4/UDP frame. See
[`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md) for the command and the latest
measured local result.

## Command-line usage

Build and run the example executable:

```text
moon run cmd/main -- --help
```

The CLI pipeline reads a capture, analyzes packet and protocol statistics, and
can emit the library's report formats. Library packages can also be composed
directly when an application needs custom ingestion or filtering.

## WebAssembly

The `src/wasm` package exposes small host-friendly functions for browser or
embedded WebAssembly integrations. Build it with the stable WebAssembly target
supported by the installed MoonBit toolchain.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs stable MoonBit checks on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows. It
checks formatting, all supported compile targets, the default test target, and
native tests on Unix runners. The workflow also verifies that formatting does
not modify tracked source.

## Publishing

Package publishing is a manual GitHub Actions workflow. It performs the same
pre-publish checks and reads a Mooncakes token from the repository secret
`MOONCAKES_TOKEN`; credentials are never committed to the repository.

## Contributing

Please add a focused test for parser behavior and malformed-input handling,
run the validation commands above, and keep public types in the package that
owns their API. Changes should remain independent of native packet-capture
libraries.
